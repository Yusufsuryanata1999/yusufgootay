1. The Agreement. This Participation Agreement ("Agreement") is between the BBB National Programs, Inc. (“BBB National Programs”), a Delaware corporation, and GootayBeramal , a Alabama corporation, and any subsidiaries or affiliates listed on this Agreement: (Collectively, "THE PARTICIPANT").
2. Participation Requirements. BBB National Programs administers the BBB Data Privacy Framework Program and Dispute Resolution Procedure (“BBB Data Privacy Framework”), which provides support to THE PARTICIPANT in achieving self-certification with the EU-U.S. and/or Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Framework(s) (the “Data Privacy Framework”) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and also provides dispute resolution services for eligible privacy complaints submitted by data subjects, against participating companies.
A.	THE PARTICIPANT represents and warrants that:
(i)	The individual signing this Agreement on behalf of THE PARTICIPANT has the authority to bind THE PARTICIPANT to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
(ii)	Following the execution of this Agreement and confirmation by BBB National Programs as a participating business in BBB Data Privacy Framework, it shall promptly file a self-certification application and will maintain a current Data Privacy Framework self-certification with the U.S. Department of Commerce for the duration of its participation in the BBB Data Privacy Framework Program.
B.	THE PARTICIPANT agrees that all subsidiaries or affiliates covered under this Agreement:
(i)	Will be listed individually in THE PARTICIPANT’S self-certification submission and in its listing on the Data Privacy Framework List maintained by the Department of Commerce; and
(ii)	Will be covered by a common Data Privacy Framework privacy policy (the “Policy”), which will be reviewed and approved by BBB National Programs. The Policy shall be displayed on each subsidiary and affiliate’s respective website, and shall include (i) a direct hyperlink to the BBB Data Privacy Framework online complaint pages; and (ii) contact information for a shared point of contact responsible for handling all Data Privacy Framework complaints for THE PARTICIPANT.

C.	THE PARTICIPANT shall notify BBB National Programs, in writing, of any proposed changes to THE PARTICIPANT’S subsidiaries or affiliates to be covered under the Agreement no less than ten (10) days in advance of the proposed change in coverage.
In any instance where BBB National Programs finds that THE PARTICIPANT has failed to comply with the foregoing provisions, BBB National Programs shall have the right to terminate this Agreement unless THE PARTICIPANT cures such non-compliance within fifteen (15) days of its receipt of written notice from BBB National Programs. BBB National Programs shall provide such notice by electronic mail to THE PARTICIPANT’s primary contact listed in BBB National Programs records pursuant to section 13 of this Agreement.
3. Advertising and Publicity. THE PARTICIPANT may use the word mark “BBB” for the sole purpose of advertising THE PARTICIPANT’S participation in the Program within THE PARTICIPANT’S website privacy policy. THE PARTICIPANT may use “BBB” only in a manner and context approved in advance by BBB National Programs. Once THE PARTICIPANT’S participation in the Program ends, THE PARTICIPANT shall immediately cease use of the word mark and confirm in writing the same. BBB National Programs reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to require THE PARTICIPANT to remove the word mark from THE PARTICIPANT’S website at any time during THE PARTICIPANT’S participation in the Program.
BBB National Programs may refer to or list THE PARTICIPANT as a member of BBB Data Privacy Framework in marketing materials and regulatory filings, and in response to inquiries by the U.S. Department of Commerce or other appropriate government agencies.
4. Procedure Requirements. BBB National Programs administers the BBB Data Privacy Framework Dispute Resolution Procedure (“the Procedure”) to address complaints brought by data subjects alleging that a Participating Business has failed to comply with the Data Privacy Framework and related documents (collectively, “the Data Privacy Framework”) with respect to personal data collected in the European Union, Switzerland, or other countries participating in the Data Privacy Frameworks, and received in the United States pursuant to Data Privacy Framework. The Procedure is governed by the BBB Data Privacy Framework Procedure Rules (“Rules”) posted on the BBB Data Privacy Framework website.
BBB National Programs may in its reasonable discretion, upon thirty (30) days prior notice to THE PARTICIPANT, alter, amend and/or update the Rules at any time and from time to time. Such notice shall be provided by electronic mail to THE PARTICIPANT’s primary contact identified in section 13 of this Agreement. Prior notice of Rules changes shall also be posted on the BBB Data Privacy Framework website.
5. Participation in the Procedure. If THE PARTICIPANT is the subject of a complaint submitted by any party to BBB Data Privacy Framework alleging a violation of the Data Privacy Framework Principles, THE PARTICIPANT agrees to participate in the Procedure in accordance with the Rules.
THE PARTICIPANT further agrees that in the event of THE PARTICIPANT’s non-compliance with the Rules or with BBB National Programs’s final determination of a complaint, BBB National Programs may take enforcement action, which may include reporting THE PARTICIPANT’s non-compliance to the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) or other appropriate government agency, as well as to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
BBB National Programs publishes an annual Procedure Report describing aggregated complaint data. THE PARTICIPANT acknowledges that in any instance when BBB National Programs refers THE PARTICIPANT to an appropriate government agency as described above, the matter, including THE PARTICIPANT’s name and the fact of the non-compliance, will be reported in a Case Report published on the BBB Data Privacy Framework website and included in the subsequent annual Procedure Report.
6. Fees and Costs. THE PARTICIPANT agrees to pay BBB National Programs the following fees and costs for its participation in the Program and the Procedure:
A.	An annual contract fee in accordance with the Program Fee Schedule posted on the BBB Data Privacy Framework website on the date that this Agreement is executed by THE PARTICIPANT or is automatically renewed. The contract fee is assessed annually on the last day of the calendar month in which THE PARTICIPANT joins the Program.

8. Indemnification. Except to the extent paid for by BBB National Programs insurance, THE PARTICIPANT will save and hold harmless BBB National Programs (including its officers, directors, employees, volunteers and independent contractors) from any and all liability, claims, damages or expenses (including attorney's fees and costs) that may be sustained by reason of or arising out of any complaint filed in the Procedure in relation to THE PARTICIPANT. BBB National Programs agrees to provide prompt notice to THE PARTICIPANT of any complaint or notice of action that may be subject to this indemnification provision, and agrees to cooperate with THE PARTICIPANT in the defense of such complaint/action. THE PARTICIPANT shall have the right to settle any such complaint/action; provided, however, that THE PARTICIPANT must give reasonable notice of any proposed settlement to BBB National Programs, and BBB National Programs has the right to reject such settlement and continue a defense of the matter at BBB National Programs’s own cost and direction. THE PARTICIPANT shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold BBB National Programs harmless in any situation where a final court judgment finds that BBB National Programs engaged in reckless or negligent activities.
9. Term. The term of this Agreement shall be for one year starting from the Effective Date. This Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms thereafter unless terminated by either party. This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days written notice; provided, however, that THE PARTICIPANT may terminate this Agreement upon written notice in response to any changes made in the Procedure Rules.
The expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not relieve either party of any obligations vested prior to the expiration or termination. Specifically, BBB National Programs will continue processing to completion any and all outstanding privacy complaints initiated against THE PARTICIPANT during the term of this Agreement. The PARTICIPANT agrees to cooperate with BBB National Programs in resolving such complaints either through settlement or through a final decision following a Data Privacy Review, and further agrees to pay BBB National Programs any outstanding fees that may be incurred pursuant to section 6 of this Agreement.

14. Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force.
